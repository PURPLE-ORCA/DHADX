# Product Description

This is a comprehensive web application designed to manage an educational and collaborative environment. It serves as a central platform for administrators, mentors, and collaborators to manage courses, track progress, and facilitate communication.

## Problem Solved

The application addresses the need for a unified system to manage the complexities of a dynamic learning environment. It solves the following problems:

-   **Fragmented Information**: Consolidates information about camps, courses, formations, specialities, and users, which might otherwise be scattered across different platforms or documents.
-   **Inefficient Task Management**: Provides a structured system for creating, assigning, and tracking tasks, including complex workflows with parent-subtask relationships, status updates, and comments.
-   **Lack of Real-time Communication**: Facilitates real-time interaction through features like notifications for task updates and a live seance environment with hand-raising and presence checks.
-   **Limited Progress Tracking**: Offers dashboards and leaderboards to monitor individual and group progress, fostering a sense of achievement and healthy competition.

## User Experience Goals

-   **Intuitive and Responsive UI**: A modern, clean, and responsive user interface built with React, Inertia.js, and Tailwind CSS ensures a seamless experience across all devices.
-   **Role-Based Access**: The application provides distinct experiences for 'admin' and 'collaborator' roles, ensuring that users only see information and actions relevant to them.
-   **Clear and Actionable Workflows**: The task management system is designed to be straightforward, with clear actions and status transitions to guide users through the process.
-   **Engaging and Interactive Learning**: Features like live seances, whiteboards, and leaderboards aim to create a more engaging and interactive learning experience.
