# Refactoring Summary: Merging Collaborator into User

A major refactoring was completed to merge the `Collaborator` model into the `User` model, simplifying the application's architecture.

## Recent Changes

### 1. Core Refactoring Steps
-   **Database**: The `users` table was extended with new columns (`birth_date`, `cin`, `gender`, `image`). The `collaborators` table and its migration were deleted. All foreign keys and pivot tables (e.g., `collaborator_speciality` to `user_speciality`) were updated to reference the `users` table.
-   **Backend**: The `User` model now includes all data and relationships previously in the `Collaborator` model. All controllers, seeders, routes, and events were updated to use the unified `User` model, and obsolete files (`Collaborator.php`, `CollaboratorController.php`, etc.) were deleted.
-   **Frontend**: All React components, API calls, and UI elements were updated to use `user` data instead of `collaborator` data. The collaborator management pages were refactored into user management pages.

### 2. Post-Refactoring Debugging
A series of issues were identified and resolved after the initial refactoring:
-   **`Class "App\Models\Collaborator" not found`**: This error appeared multiple times.
    -   **Attempt 1**: Resolved a caching issue by running `php artisan optimize:clear` and `composer dump-autoload`.
    -   **Attempt 2**: Fixed a hardcoded reference in `DashboardController.php` and a related bug in `dashboard.jsx`.
    -   **Attempt 3**: Corrected the `attendees` relationship in the `Seance` model which was still pointing to the old `Collaborator` model.
-   **`Uncaught ReferenceError: Masonry is not defined`**: Fixed by adding the missing `import Masonry from 'react-masonry-css';` statement in `dashboard.jsx`.
-   **`Ziggy error: route 'users.index' is not in the route list`**: Resolved by correcting the route definition in `routes/web.php` and running `php artisan route:cache`.
-   **`SyntaxError: ...does not provide an export named 'users'`**: Fixed a typo in an import statement in `app-sidebar.jsx`, changing the icon import from `users` to `Users`.

## Next Steps
-   The application is now stable after the refactoring. The next development task can begin, using the updated and simplified architecture.
# Context

## Current Work Focus

The current focus is on the initial setup and population of the Memory Bank. This involves a thorough analysis of the existing codebase to create a comprehensive and accurate set of documentation that will serve as the foundation for all future development work.

## Recent Changes

-   **Initialized Memory Bank**: Created the core memory bank files: `product.md`, `architecture.md`, and `tech.md`.
-   **Project Analysis**: Completed a detailed analysis of the project structure, including the Laravel backend, React frontend, and key dependencies.

## Next Steps

-   **User Verification**: Request the user to review the newly created Memory Bank files to ensure their accuracy and completeness.
-   **Begin Development**: Once the Memory Bank is verified, proceed with the next development task, using the established documentation as a guide.
